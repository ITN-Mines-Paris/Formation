# Digital Research Project

## Anatomy

--- 

## General Goal

  - Maximize the utility of your research (for you and others)

  - Here : share every component of value from your research

---

Leads:

1. identify all research products/artefacts and their nature
    (any potential holder of value)

2. split / decompose / untangle them (reductionist)

3. expose the links between them (source/causality analysis)

4. Share the project history

## Nature of Artifacts

Let's use the software engineering linguo:
**Artifact** 
to refer to any 
**Digital Research Product**.

---

  - Document
  - Data
  - Software

  - Metadata
  - Configuration
  - Build
  - ...

Definitions? Examples first, extract the definition from them.

Examples : some simple and some not so simple / blur the distinctions. Sometimes views rather then different kinds.

Why does the kind identif. matter? "Optimizations"/proper forms are type-specific.
